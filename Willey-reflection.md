#Reflection
1. I had never ran into a merge conflict prior to the GPS. It was great to see how they occur and what the result of a conflict is.
2. There were many little bits of Git that I gained clarity on. I had studied the workflow prior to the GPS, but actually working through it was a huge help.
3. I asked quite a few questions through out; mainly syntax (and I learned a lot of great shortcuts from it).
4. The only thing that still confuses me about Git is when to use fetch and merge vs pull. Our guide went over it, and I felt I got the idea, however I think I need to experience the situation before I'll be confident on using fetch.
5. This was a really great experience. I liked working with my partner and felt the guide was super helpful. She also gave us tips on things slightly outside the module that I'll be using for the rest of my time programming.
